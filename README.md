## 1 Projects

### 1.1 Programming Language: Python

#### Analysis and Visualization

- 	[Analysis of Smoking data](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Knowledge%20Collection/Statistics%20and%20Visualization%20in%20Python.html): Includes Mean, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation & Histograms _Tools: Python(Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib)_
	
-	[Analysis of Airbnb data](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Knowledge%20Collection/AirBnB%20Analysis.pdf): I drafted an analysis that covers an Airbnb dataset of over 41,000 tuples and 95 attributes. In this paper, I am applying the concept of Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) when analyzing the dataset. The quantitative and qualitative analysis includes a variety of visualization (Python, Excel) as well as different regression models (including optimal selection of features). _Tools: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SKlearn), Excel 365, Tableau_

#### Machine Learning
- [k-Nearest-Neighbor](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Knowledge%20Collection/Classification%20with%20nearest%20neighbors.html): In this project, I will perform classification with the nearest neighbor classifier, a non-linear, non-parametric method for classification. Then I will apply cross-validation for model selection and standard data normalization for preprocessing.

- [Random Forest](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Random%20Forest.ipynb): Train a random forest with 50 trees test the resulting classifier using test dat. _Tools: Python (scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)_ 

#### Independent Projects
- [Job Web Crawler](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-project-who-looking-enthusiasts-frankfurt-germany-kn%C3%B6dler): I've decided to build my very first web crawler to collect information about jobs in my home city, Frankfurt. In this short post, I would like to share with you some knowledge about how to crawl data from webpages as well as some thoughts on the results of my very short analysis.

### 1.2 Programming Language: R
- Data Analysis and Visualization
	-	[Analysis and Visualization Scool data](https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Knowledge%20Collection/Analysis%20and%20Visualization%20using%20R.ipynb): Analyze and visualize data of 5 different school which have implemented the same math course this semester, with 35 lessons. _Tools: R(dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, ggubr, reshape2)_

### 1.3 Cloud Computing
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
	- [Host Webpage in AWS Cloud](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SKnoedler/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Knowledge%20Collection/Github%20Webpage%20hosted%20on%20AWS%20Cloud.html): Amazon provides a variety of web services, one of them is the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). EC2 provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. Therefore, it balances computing power, memory and networking resources. EC2 allows users to configure a Virtual Machine (VM)/ instance to deploy application content. In this task, I show and explain how I hosted a webpage from GitHub to an instance in EC2.

### 2.3 Personal Interest
- [Deep Probabilistic Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-probabilistic-programming-steffen-knödler/): One of our Data Science professors Thomas Hamelryck introduced us to Deep Probabilistic Programming (Deep PP) during a lecture in the second semester of my studies. This short blog post on LinkedIn introduces the idea of Deep PP and explains what it is  all about. I think Deep PP is a very exciting field of study and I cannot wait to learn more.
